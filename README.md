# Linker

This project was completed as part of my Operating Systems course at NYU, taught by Alan Gottlieb in the Fall 2016 semester. The lab was to create a program that would simulate a two-pass linker based on file input with definitions, uses, and memory addresses (relative, absolute, immediate, external) -- with error detection.

# To run this program:
```
> javac Linker.java
> java Linker input_set_[1-8].txt
```
